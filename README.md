Get text from keyboard and print on screen.

Done to let my child play with the computer...

It's supposed to be hard to quit.

# Keys
F10 - quit by pressing more than 4 times followed by 'q'

F1 - clear screen

F9 - toggle all uppercase letters

Arrows - move around the screen

Backspace - remove previous char but leaves the rest of the line as is

# Issues
Does not handle uppercase for non-ASCII

# Other
Anything can change without notice!
